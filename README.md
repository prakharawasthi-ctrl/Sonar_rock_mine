This project aims to classify sonar signals as either mines or rocks using various machine learning algorithms. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and comparison of different models to determine the best performing one.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Sonar Mines vs. Rocks dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset consists of 208 instances, each with 60 attributes representing sonar signals.

Model
The project explores several machine learning algorithms, including:

Logistic Regression


Results
The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results are summarized in a table to compare the effectiveness of each algorithm.

Model	                 Accuracy	  Precision	Recall	F1-Score
Logistic Regression      	85%	     0.84	     0.85	    0.84
